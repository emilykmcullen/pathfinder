# :worm: cute-game diary :worm:
### Description
I'm making a little game using C++ and SDL in my spare time, this is a sort of diary/log of things I add to it. The main purpose of this project is just to experiment with things for the sake of learning and not be precious about anything I'm doing (it can all be thrown away!). 


### :hedgehog: Day 1 - 3 (21st - 23rd Sept) :hedgehog:
* Basic game loop stuff implemented (opening a window, processing input, update loop, rendering)
* Created 'scenes' and 'boxes' to fill scenes (the boxes are to be used behind-the-scenes as walk boxes for the player etc)
* Functionality to ensure a 'box' knows the box to it's north, east, south, west
* Can look up boxes either by id OR by a 'midpoint' key (explanation why I've done it like this below)
* Functionality to colour the scene boxes (this is not for the game and is only useful for my debugging/testing purposes, also it's fun)
* Can click in a box and find what the id of that box is

### :hedgehog: Looking up boxes by midpoint - why :hedgehog:

I know I need some way to find a box's id. 
Two example usages I can think of for why I need this: 
* If the user clicks in a spot in the game window, I want to know what 'box' those screen coords are within so I can check info about the box (eg. is that box walkable? etc.)
* When initializing boxes for a scene (which happens when a scene is initialized), for each 'box' I want it to know the boxes that are to the north, east, south and west of it (for pathfinding etc), I don't know these other box id's when I am initializing the current box but I can find their location relative to the current box, so I can use that to get the id's perhaps?

So my solution for this was that if I can find the approx midpoint for each box (I have the origin x and y of my current box so I can use that and the BOX_WIDTH/BOX_HEIGHT to find the origin x/y of the other boxes surrounding it, and then use that plus half of the BOX_WIDTH/BOX_HEIGHT to find an approx midpoint) then I can use that value to create a key for each box and store it's id as the value at that key. SO then, for example, if I click an area on the screen I can find the origin x/y of that box (by rounding down to the nearest multiple of box_width/box_height for the x/y coords of my click), then I can find the midpoint, convert it to the format I used for my key and then use that key to look up which box the click was in!

**Next Steps**
Over the next few days I want to:
* Create some sort of player character represented visually by a sprite
* If the user clicks on an area in the window:
* Find the square that the user clicked within
* Find out if that square is walkable
* If it is walkable, find the shortest path to that square
* Make the player 'walk' that path to the destination square


### :hedgehog: Day 4 (25th Sept) :hedgehog:
I need to create some sort of pathfinder for my player to be able to click in a destination box and find a path to that box.
I've never made a pathfinder before, I've heard about things such as A* and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm but I decided to try and work something out myself before researching better ways to do it, so that's what I spent the afternoon doing today. 
What I did today:
* Made a pathfinder that works but it's very messy and probably not very good, however I'm really happy I managed to get it working first without looking up how to do it!
* The code is extremely messy, my next steps this week will be to clean this up
* I have a 'list' class, which is more like 'PathfindingLinkedList' because it's not useable for anything else, however the C++ intellisense on VScode is terrible and it's too annoying to rename it right now
* There are situations I haven't dealt with such as; if a destination value that doesn't exist is entered, and secondly, some boxes will be walkable and some not-walkable, I haven't taken this into consideration yet
* Lots of other things are not really where they should be either, but I basically just wanted to get something working
* Also not sure if I will clean it up or just get rid of it, as my solution is obviously quite crude and maybe now I have a solution I'll get rid of it and research into A* algorithm instead 

**Next Steps**
Over the next few days I want to:
* Clean up my pathfinding code and/or implement A* pathfinding algorithm instead
* Do the other steps in my previous next steps! 

### :hedgehog: Day 5 (26th Sept) :hedgehog:
* Decided I'm going to keep going with my own pathfinder (instead of implementing a better way such as A*) for now, as it'll be a useful exercise - until at some point it's too slow or whatever and I need to implement a better way
* Cleaned up a little (moved some of the code from Utils to Scene, renamed some things)
* Had a quick go at deleting the tree nodes before dinner, seems to work for what I've tested so far but need to look into it/test more

### :hedgehog: Day 6 (28th Sept) :hedgehog:
* Scrapped the changes I made the other day as I realised there is no need for them and they make things more complicated
* Changed pathfinder to search boxes based on direction 
* It's working better 
* I'm going on holiday tomorrow and I really wanted to visualize the pathfinder working so I quickly wrote some code to visualize a player moving around, which works and is nice to see :D buuuut this code is HORRENDOUS and full of potential bug cases and so first thing when I'm back off holiday I'll just be cleaning everything up
* My main goal before I went on holiday was to write some kind of pathfinder and visualize a player moving around this path, so I've achieved that!

**Next Steps**
When I'm back off holiday in around 10 days:
* CLEAN UP!!!!!!
